            <a id="submission"><h2>Submission categories</h2></a>
            <p>Authors can submit a paper in one of the following categories:</p>
		<ul class="topics-list">
		  <li><b style="color:black">Research Papers (12 pages)</b>: describe original research, where 
		      novelty is a primary consideration.</li>
		  <li><b style="color:black">Industry and System Papers (12 pages)</b>: 
		      describe important industrial advances and application 
		      achievements. It encourages work on applying recent research advances to real-world problems 
		      and industrial systems. Moreover, new applications, novel systems, challenging real-world use 
		      cases, practical customer case studies, as well as analysis of applied technology in an 
		      industrial context are highly welcome.</li>
		  <li><b style="color:black">Vision Papers (6 pages)</b>: 
		      describe speculative but well-reasoned and thought-provoking ideas, 
		      where insight is a primary consideration. Vision papers should present ideas and solutions that 
		      differ from prior work and the status quo. A full-fledged system implementation is not required, 
		      but empirical evidence and measurements may be helpful in illustrating the feasibility of the 
		      proposed vision.</li>
            	</ul> <br>
            	<p>
			Submissions will be judged based on their originality, technical merit,
			relevance, value to the community, and likelihood of producing interesting
			discussions at the symposium. Submissions will be kept confidential until
			accepted. Rejected submissions will be kept confidential permanently.
            	</p>

            <a id="guidelines"><h2>Submission guidelines</h2></a>
            
		    <p>Authors must submit original papers that are not being considered for publication in other forums. 
	  	    Submissions cannot be accompanied by nondisclosure, confidentiality, or similar agreements. Further, 
		    all submitted papers must cite and clearly differentiate from relevant prior publications, including 
		    workshop papers from the same or other authors.</p>
		  
		    <p>Papers that violate the below requirements will be rejected without reviews. 
		    Judicious use of color is permitted, but the paper should print clearly in black and white. 
		    Non-rejected papers will be shepherded, and final acceptance will be conditional on the shepherd’s 
		    approval. </p>
		  
		    <p> Reviewing for <b> Research and Vision papers is double-anonymous </b> (i.e., author identities 
            will be kept confidential from reviewers during the review process, and vice versa). 
		    Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify 
		    themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). 
		    Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review. 
		   
        	<p> Reviewing for <b>Industry and System papers is transparent with respect to the company/product, 
		    but double-anonymous with respect to the authors</b>. That is, you need not anonymize the company 
		    or products/services you are referring to.  However, you should not reveal the paper’s author 
		    names directly in your submission.</p>
		  
		    <p>If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, please contact 
	        the program co-chairs (contacts at the end of the page) well in advance of the 
	 	    submission deadline. </p>
 
            
            <h3>Formatting</h3>
            <p>Submissions can have up to 12 pages for Research and Industry papers, and 6 pages for Vision papers; 
            this limit includes the title, abstract, and appendices. Bibliographic references are not included in 
            the page limit. Use US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a (7 x 9 in) block 
            centered on the page, using two columns separated by 0.33 in of whitespace. Use 10-point font on 12-point 
            (single-spaced) leading. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without 
            magnification. All pages should be numbered and references within the paper should be hyperlinked.
            </p>
            <p>Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no 
            extensions for fixing violations. We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before 
            the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules.
            </p>
            <p>Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official 
            <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions">SIGPLAN Latex or MS Word templates from 
            the ACM</a>, which we recommend using for submission. For Latex, we recommend you use:
            </p>

            <code>
            \documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart}<br>
            \renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}<br>
            \pagestyle{plain}<br>
            . . .<br>
            \settopmatter{printfolios=true}<br>
            \maketitle<br>
            </code>

            <h3>Paper type</h3>
            	<p> After the author list, papers should indicate the submission type (research, industry, vision).</p>
			
			
            <h3>Guidance on Inclusion</h3>
	    <p>
		Submitters are encouraged to use inclusive language and examples in their papers.  
		This includes using inclusive language in gendered nouns and pronouns (for example, 
		see this <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/gender-inclusive-language/" 
		style="color:red">article</a> on gender-inclusive language), and inclusive examples 
		when describing people (for example, see this 
		<a href="https://medium.com/@arunis100/inclusive-cs-examples-b5f40e003815" style="color:red">blogpost</a> 
		on inclusive examples).
